We implemented our program by first connecting to the mongo db with proper commands to refresh or load databases. The queries run and execute on all 7 given test cases. The output html will be the output field in the config field if present. If this is not present, we have a different naming convention of config[number]out.html. Lastly, while using pyplot the ambari server throws a warning regarding the graphics.
